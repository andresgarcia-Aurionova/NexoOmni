# Running with Docker

The repo ships a multi-stage `Dockerfile` (Next.js standalone output,
runs as a non-root user) and a `docker-compose.yml` with a single
`app` service. Supabase is external — point the app at your hosted
(or self-hosted) Supabase project via env vars; no database container
is included.

## Quick start

1. Copy the env template and fill it in:

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Build and start (the `--env-file` flag is required — Compose only
   reads `.env` by default for `${VAR}` substitution, and this project
   keeps its config in `.env.local`):

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.local up --build -d
   ```

3. The app is served on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   (publish it elsewhere with `HOST_PORT=8080` in `.env.local`).

> Use `HOST_PORT`, not `PORT`, to move the published port. `PORT` is
> what the server listens on _inside_ the container, and `env_file`
> would inject it there — leaving the app on a port the mapping and
> the healthcheck don't target. Compose pins it to 3000 for that
> reason.

## Build-time vs runtime variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are **inlined into the client bundle at
  build time**. They are passed as Docker build args by
  `docker-compose.yml`. If you change any of them, rebuild:
  `docker compose --env-file .env.local up --build -d`.
- Everything else (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
  `META_APP_SECRET`, …) is read at **runtime** from `.env.local` via
  `env_file` and is never baked into the image — safe to change with
  just a container restart.

Web Push is an exception to the usual `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` build-time rule:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_PUSH_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` is retrieved through the
authenticated subscription API at runtime. Configure it together with
`WEB_PUSH_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` and `WEB_PUSH_VAPID_SUBJECT` in the runtime
environment, never as private build arguments. Re-enable device
subscriptions after rotating the VAPID key pair.

Generate the pair once with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys` and set
`WEB_PUSH_VAPID_SUBJECT` to a contact such as `mailto:soporte@tu-dominio.com`.
If the logs show `[web-push] Delivery is blocked by missing or invalid VAPID
configuration`, these variables are absent from the running container.
Queued alerts older than 15 minutes are discarded (`last_error = 'expired'`),
so fixing the keys does not replay an old backlog.

## Easypanel: avoid secrets in Nixpacks images

If the build log contains `SecretsUsedInArgOrEnv` for server keys and
`NIXPACKS_PATH`, it may be using a **generated Nixpacks Dockerfile**
rather than the Dockerfile in this repository. The repository Dockerfile
does not declare server secrets as build arguments.

For this application, select the **Dockerfile** build method in your
Easypanel service and use the repository-root `Dockerfile` with the
repository root as its build context. Keep the service's domain, port
and runtime configuration unchanged. Exact menu labels can vary by
Easypanel version.

- Pass only the public `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` build arguments declared by that
  Dockerfile. Public Supabase project URL and anon/publishable key are
  expected in the browser bundle; a service-role key is not.
- Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, provider API keys,
  OAuth client secrets, SMTP credentials and worker/webhook secrets in
  **runtime environment variables**, not build arguments or Dockerfile
  `ENV` instructions. Do not prefix them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
- Do not put a filled-in `.env.local` in Git or the Docker build context.
- Redeploy a fresh image after changing the builder. Check the new logs
  and, privately, the image configuration/history to confirm that server
  secrets are absent. Do not paste image metadata or secret values into
  tickets or shared logs.

The warnings indicate a possible exposure path, not proof that someone
obtained the secrets. If the old image was accessible outside the
trusted deployment team, revoke/rotate the affected API keys, service
credentials and shared worker/webhook secrets, update runtime variables,
and stop using the old image. Review image-registry access and retained
build caches as well.

**Do not replace `ENCRYPTION_KEY` blindly:** existing encrypted
integration credentials depend on it. Plan a coordinated migration or
re-entry of those credentials before rotating that key, otherwise
existing connections can become unreadable.

`UndefinedVar NIXPACKS_PATH` concerns the generated build configuration;
it is not a confirmed vulnerability by itself. Switching to the
repository Dockerfile removes dependence on that generated variable.
If retaining Nixpacks, inspect its generated plan and configure its
supported runtime-only secret mechanism instead of ignoring the warnings.

## Plain Docker (no Compose)

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key \
  -t wacrm .

docker run -d --env-file .env.local -e PORT=3000 -p 3000:3000 wacrm
```

## Notes

### Dependency security checks

Use `npm ci` for reproducible installs from the committed lockfile.
Check both production and development dependencies:

```bash
npm audit --omit=dev
npm audit
```

As of 2026-11-08, the application and MCP server production lockfiles
pass `npm audit --omit=dev` with **zero vulnerabilities**. The full
application audit reports 13 development dependency findings: 2 low and
11 moderate, involving `deepmerge` and `minimatch` through tooling such
as shadcn and ESLint. Audit results can change as new advisories are
published. Build containers install development tools too, so treat
development dependency findings as relevant to the build environment.

Do not use `npm audit fix --force` to silence these remaining alerts:
the proposed downgrades change the lint/scaffolding stack and are not a
compatible security patch. Run those tools only on trusted projects and
patterns, and recheck for an upstream patch.

The Next.js and ESLint config versions are kept aligned. Nodemailer 10
bundles its TypeScript definitions; `@types/nodemailer` must not be
installed alongside it.

Next 16.4's updated React Hooks lint configuration enables additional React
Compiler checks. The existing codebase has outstanding findings for
`set-state-in-effect`, `preserve-manual-memoization` and `immutability`;
these three checks are warnings during the transition and should be
addressed before making them errors. Other existing lint rules remain in
effect.

### Runtime operations

- Database migrations under `supabase/` are **not** run by the
  container — apply them with the Supabase CLI as described in the
  README.
- The Docker entrypoint uses `scripts/start-standalone.mjs`, the same
  launcher as the Nixpacks deployment. With `APP_URL` and
  `AI_ANALYSIS_WORKER_SECRET`, it runs the existing analysis/report
  worker every minute, including the Web Push queue. The launcher also
  runs flow cleanup, webhook delivery and retention when their respective
  secrets are configured. A missing secret is logged explicitly and
  leaves that worker disabled. Rebuild older Docker images to obtain
  this entrypoint; do not run an additional external scheduler for the
  same jobs.
- Automation **Wait** steps still need an external scheduler targeting
  `GET /api/automations/cron` with `x-cron-secret` set to
  `AUTOMATION_CRON_SECRET`; the launcher only schedules flow cleanup,
  not this automation endpoint.
- If you override the entrypoint to run `server.js` directly, arrange
  your own scheduler for the required workers. The existing scripts
  under `scripts/` provide the authenticated requests. The optional
  retention job remains a no-op until an operator sets a retention
  window on the Platform page.
